# Tracking Product Views

> Example product view request

```javascript
_dcq.push(
  [
    "track", "Viewed a Product",
    {
      product_id: "B01J4SWO1G",
      product_variant_id: "B01J4SWO1G-CW-BOTT",
      sku: "XHB-1234",
      name: "The Coolest Water Bottle",
      categories: "Accessories,Bottles",
      price: 11.16,
      currency: "USD",
      product_url: "https://mysuperstore.com/dp/B01J4SWO1G",
      image_url: "https://www.getdrip.com/images/example_products/water_bottle.png",
      brand: "Drip",
      source: "my_custom_platform"
    }
  ]
);
```

You can use the <code>track</code> method to send product views to Drip. By sending with a "Viewed a product" <code>action</code> and sending product data via the <a href="#product-activity">Shopper Activity API</a>, you can segment on product views in Drip.

### Properties
