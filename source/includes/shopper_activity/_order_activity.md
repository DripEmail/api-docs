# Order Activity

Note that Order Activity will show up on a person's activity timeline as either a "Placed an order" or "Updated an order" event. An Order's <code>order_id</code> is unique. The first order event for a given <code>order_id</code> will result in a "Placed an order" event on the person's timeline in Drip. Subsequent events for that order will result in "Updated an order" events.

The API will also allow custom attributes to be passed in. These will be exposed within Drip just like [event properties](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003737312-Event-Properties).

For example, if your platform includes the concept of product tags, you can include a product_tag attribute in the JSON that can be used in a Drip automation or email [via Liquid](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003737312-Event-Properties#access-properties). You can attach custom attributes either to event (top level object) or items.
