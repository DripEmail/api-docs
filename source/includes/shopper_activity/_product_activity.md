# Product Activity

Product Activity will not show up directly on people's timelines. If a product's price is updated, then a "Product price reduced" event will show on the timeline of any person who has added that product to a cart at a higher price within the last 2 weeks and who has not placed an order for that product.

## Create or update a product

To update an existing product, include the <code>provider</code> and <code>product_id</code> for that order in the payload.

> To record an order event:

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.getdrip.com/v3/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/shopper_activity/product" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'User-Agent: Your App Name (www.yourapp.com)' \

The API will also allow custom attributes to be passed in. These will be exposed within Drip just like [event properties](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003737312-Event-Properties).

For example, if your platform includes the concept of product tags, you can include a product_tag attribute in the JSON that can be used in a Drip automation or email [via Liquid](https://help.drip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003737312-Event-Properties#access-properties). You can attach custom attributes either to events or their items.
