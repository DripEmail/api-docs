# Introduction

Welcome to the Drip API! The REST API communicates exclusively in JSON over SSL (HTTPS).
All endpoint URLs begin with `https://api.drip.com/v2/`.

Parameters must be serialized in JSON and passed in the request body (not in the query string or form parameters).
This API is modeled after earlier versions of the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification.

It is recommended that you use the media type designation of `application/vnd.api+json`,
although we will accept a media type designation of `application/json`.
